This Project involves analyzing genome data for detecting autism. In our study, we have used a random forest base model, and then applied three different algorithms - GBM, Adaboost, and XGBoost - to perform a comparative analysis of their performance in autism detection.

Our goal is to determine which algorithm provides the best accuracy in detecting autism, and to identify any potential areas of improvement. We believe that our study will contribute to the field of autism detection and help improve the accuracy and efficiency of future diagnostic tools.

# Our project: 
To start our project, we performed some preprocessing and feature engineering on the genome data. This included removing irrelevant features, normalizing the data, and selecting relevant genetic markers. We then used statistical techniques to identify genetic variations that are associated with autism.

After this, we trained a random forest model to detect autism from the genetic markers. Random forest is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, particularly when dealing with large and complex datasets like genome data. The random forest algorithm creates multiple decision trees using subsets of the features and observations, then combines their predictions to make a final prediction.

To improve our baseline performance from the random forest model, we tested other algorithms to see if they performed better or worse than the random forest. We tested Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Adaboost, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, which are all boosting algorithms that work by combining multiple weaker models to create a stronger ensemble model. These algorithms are known for their ability to handle high-dimensional and noisy data, making them suitable for genome data analysis.

After testing the algorithms, we compared their performance in detecting autism from the genome data. We used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of each algorithm. We also used statistical tests to determine if the differences in performance were statistically significant.

Our project is a valuable contribution to the field of autism research, and it demonstrates the power of machine learning algorithms in analyzing complex genetic data. We hope that our research will help to improve our understanding of autism and lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment options for individuals with autism.
