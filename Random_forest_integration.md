This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict genes that may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The project uses three different random forest models trained on different datasets to generate predictions on genes that have not yet been studied for their association with ASD.

The first dataset used is the BrainSpan dataset, which includes gene expression data from the brains of individuals at different ages. This dataset was used to train a random forest model to predict which genes are likely to be associated with ASD based on their expression levels. The model was trained using a balanced sample of genes that have been previously associated with ASD and genes that have not been studied for their association with ASD. The trained model was then used to generate predictions on the remaining genes in the dataset.

The second dataset used is the STRING dataset, which includes information on protein-protein interactions. This dataset was used to train another random forest model to predict which genes are likely to be associated with ASD based on their interactions with other proteins. The model was trained using a balanced sample of genes that have been previously associated with ASD and genes that have not been studied for their association with ASD. The trained model was then used to generate predictions on the remaining genes in the dataset.

The third dataset used is the TADA dataset, which includes information on genes that are known to be associated with ASD. This dataset was used to provide additional information on genes that may be associated with ASD.

Finally, the predictions generated by the BrainSpan and STRING models were integrated using a third random forest model to generate a combined score for each gene. The combined score takes into account the predicted association of each gene with ASD based on both its expression levels and its interactions with other proteins.

Overall, this project is innovative in its use of multiple datasets and machine learning techniques to generate predictions on genes that have not yet been studied for their association with ASD. The project has the potential to identify novel genes that are associated with ASD, which could lead to a better understanding of the disorder and the development of new therapies.
